## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Express

Once I came up with the idea it was simple to incorporate the post method to the profile. The hardest part for me was thinking of a put method to update the messages. I was able to add the fire, and the book mark to update the color, and number of support.

## Lessons Learned:

I now am getting more creative with other ways to update/put on the server, which will be helpful for future projects.
